I, Charles Sy, made this into a simple HeapSort program. At the start of the menu, you have to type in “COMMANDS” to see a list of available commands. 
Here are other commands to type in:
•	END - to end the program. 
•	LIST -  will bring up the initial list of employees and their id’s, unsorted. 
•	ORDER – descending order the list by id.
•	REVERSE_ORDER – list put in an ascending order by id.
•	RESET – will reset the employee list to the initial state.
